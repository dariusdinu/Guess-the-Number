   GUESS MY NUMBER!

   This is a project that I have managed to create based on a Udemy course that I'm taking - "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!"

   How to play

The goal is to guess a secret number between 1 and 20. You can type a number and the app is going to provide a message based on how far or close your guess is. The screen turns green when the user guesses the number and at that point it may or it may not have achieved a highscore, which is another feature of this small application. If you want to play again just click the "Again" button and everything resets, except for the highscore. Have fun!
